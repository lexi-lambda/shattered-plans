## 0.0.7 (not yet released)

* Systems that are threatened by a neighboring hostile force are now overlaid with orange cross-hatching instead of yellow cross-hatching. Yellow cross-hatching is now used exclusively for systems at risk of collapse due to insufficient garrison.

* The bright yellow cross-hatching used to indicate systems at risk of immediate collapse is now applied more consistently and accurately. Previously, some systems could be shaded with faded yellow cross-hatching even though they were at risk of immediate collapse, but now dim yellow cross-hatching is only applied to systems at risk of collapse due to a chain reaction.

* While placing a terraforming project, resources that are currently in surplus are colored green in the production panel, and systems that only provide a single unit of that resource (and provide no other resources) are highlighted green on the map.

## 0.0.6 (2022-12-04)

* Added experimental support for custom UI scaling via the `funorb.shatteredplans.client.uiScale` and `funorb.shatteredplans.client.aspectRatio` JVM properties. See the README for more details.

* Fixed game chat messages being sent as lobby chat messages.

## 0.0.5 (2022-10-01)

* Initial public release.
